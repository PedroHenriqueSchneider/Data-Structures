# Data-Structures
Different data structures are appropriate for different types of data and different types of operations that you might need to perform on that data. Some common examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
As a computer science student, I focus on learning theoretical subjects to develop logical reasoning, such as data structures and discrete mathematics.
